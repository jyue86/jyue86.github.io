Abstract
--------
In this project, we aim to utilize Reinforcement Learning to create a controller that
allows a robot to play a game of air hockey. Our report details the progression
of ideas and algorithms used to achieve the best current results on the problem.
We initially experimented with classical policy gradient algorithms such as REIN-
FORCE. Afterward, we found the need to progress towards Actor-Critic methods
and eventually imitation learning procedures. We intend to discuss the role each
algorithm plays in our finalized product, and its importance in other reinforcement
learning-related tasks in robotics. Next, we talk about our experimental IK2PD
model and future work to further this project.
