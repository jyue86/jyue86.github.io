Abstract
--------
In this project, I cover my process on how to perform distributed SLAM, where
multiple cameras can be used to create the map of an environment. After listing
the tools that I use to solve this problem and my setup environment, my final
report covers the step by step pipeline that I use, which includes calibration, visual
odometry, the backend optimization, and merging the individual maps into a final
map. For each step, I demonstrate they have an impact on the final result and where
applicable, go over the theory. After discussing the final result, I will also talk
about future works and experiments to improve on my current progress.
