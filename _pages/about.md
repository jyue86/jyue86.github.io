I'm currently a 4th year undergraduate student at the University of California, Irvine. Currently, I work at the Autonomous System Smart Guard, led by Professor Qi Alfred Chen. My interest lies at the intersection of computer vision, machine learning (namely adversarial machine learning), and reinforcement learning.

Previously, I interned at Meta Reality Labs as a Business Software Engineer Intern. Currently, I work part-time at NAV RoboTaxis.
